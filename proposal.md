# Title
Photo Manipulation Program

## Repository
<https://github.com/Chaos198177/ANGM-2305.0W2-Final-Project.git>

## Description
This program will take an image or series of images and convert it to a new format based on the user's input. For example, if the user submits a series of JPEGs and wants to convert it to one GIF, the program will do so. If the user submits one PNG and wants to convert it to a JPG, it will do so. 

## Features
- Feature 1
	- It will be able to take a file from anywhere in the user's computer and convert it. I plan to use different classes to accomplish this.
- Feature 2
  - A list of different conversion formats will be available to choose from. If the user selects the format that the image/s are already in, the program will account for that and return a statement asking for another selection. 
- Feature 3 
	- The program will create the new file and store it in the folder that the original image/s came from without replacing them. It will be under a new, recognizable name.

## Challenges
- I will need to figure out how to make the program pull a file from the user's input instead of the program code directly.
- I will need to research sufficient ways of how to execute pieces of code based on the user's input.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is that the program will successfully follow the user input's directions and convert the image or series of images into whatever the user desires. I would like the program to account for all contingences.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The program needs to at least be able to pull the requested file from the user's home desktop so that it can be converted.
